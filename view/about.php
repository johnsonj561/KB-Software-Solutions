              <p>KB Software Solutions is independently owned and operated by Justin Johnson in Boynton Beach Florida. As a Computer
                Engineering and Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University, KB Software Solutions released it's first 
                commercial website in December of 2014. Sharp Cut Lawn Service in New Jersey <a href="http://www.sharpcutlawns.com">went online</a>
                when Justin Johnson presented the design to his father, owner of Sharp Cut Lawn Service, as a Christmas present.</p>
              <p>KB Software Solution's first commercial web design not only made for a great surpirse Christmas present, but
                generated more inquiries and new business than ever anticipated. With the help of it's new
                website, Sharp Cut maxed out it's work load for 2015 and began referring new customers to other
                local trusted businesses.</p>

              <p>Google's development tools revealed a surprising 1000 + page views per month shortly after this first site was
                launched. 97% of these page views were new visitors, and the average monthly page views is steadily increasing with time. Our
                first web design achieved a high search ranking and began appearing within top 3 search results within months of it's
                release. It's no wonder Sharp Cut Lawn Service business sky rocketed in Spring of 2015!</p>
              <p>Core development techniques and SEO strategies allowed this small business to reach many new faces and attract new customers
                like never imagined. Developer, Justin Johnson, quickly began producing similar designs for friends and family interested in
                taking their business to the next level. With a rapidly growing interest in web development and software design, Justin
                formed the KB Software Solutions LLC and began producing professional websites for small businesses throughout
                the country.
