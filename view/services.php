          <p>KB Software Solutions provides efficient website designs to small and medium sized businesses at an affordable
            rate. An up to date website that is optimized to today's search engine algorithms is one of the most effective
            ways of attracting new customers to any business.</p>
          <p>Today's technologies give business owners several options when creating a new website. The path you
            choose when launching your website should depend on your business plan, technical ability, finances, 
            overall goals, and the amount of personal time that you are willing to invest.
            Companies like <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/home/overview/">Foursquare</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, and 
            <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> offer online tools that allow business owners to purchase 
            domain names and piece together their own website from a personal computer with no programming skills and very little
            investment. Consumers will select from pre-defined layouts, update it with their own images and content, and the 
            code required to render the website will be magically generated behind the scenes. These services have some 
            limitations and do require some technical ability to be successful, but KB Software Solutions encourages 
            it's customers to explore these options when determining how to launch their next website.</p>
          <p>Hiring an experienced developer to design and implement your web site has many benefits. If you are a serious
            business owner looking to make a big impression on your potential customers, than having a developer generate
            a custom design that is optimized to current internet marketing standards is worth considering.</p>

            engines aim to provide it's users with the most useful resources. If you're site has not received
            any attention in months or years it will eventually go "stale" and be pushed to the bottom of the list.

          <p>Have you ever wondered how search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo find exactly what you're looking for within 
            seconds? Search engines rely on stategic algorithms to examine website layouts, performance and efficiency, 
            traffic, bounce rates, freshness, and much more. Search engines are "crawling" the web around the clock, collecting data
            and pumping it through lengthy equations to refine the search results displayed to users.
          </p>
          <p>Working with an experienced developer will ensure that your online business meets the most current
            SEO standards. The less expensive, do-it-yourself website generators available online
            will undoubtedly fall short here. The automatic code produced by their software is less efficient, 
            resulting in lower SEO scores, potentially limiting the number of customers reached.KB Software
            Solutions can help your business compete with the thousands of online businesses by applying proven
